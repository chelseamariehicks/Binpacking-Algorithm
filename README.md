# Binpacking-Algorithm
Program reads inputs from a file named bin.txt which consists of test cases where the first line is the number of test cases, followed by the capacity of bins for that test case the number of items, and then the weight of each item. With this information, the program runs three separate algorithms aimed at optimizing the bin packing problem, which is to pack items of different weights into the fewest number of bins with a specific capacity. The three algorithms used to solve the bin packing problem in this program are First-Fit, First-Fit-Decreasing, and Best Fit. The specifics of each algorithm are described in comments before their declaration. In the end, each algorithm will return the number of bins found to be needed according to that algorithm.
